            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Take therefore this Book, reade it your ſelf, and explain it to others, leaſt that Gulf in the Title, ETERNITY, catch and involve thoſe at unawares that might fore-run it. Let the Reader know that it is alwayes to be thought on, though never to be underſtood. Let him believe that every moment we travell unto it, and ſhall quickly come to our journeys end, that vaſt place of entertainment, the Inne of Eternitie: Let him look he beſpeaks good Lodging, and good Company; for the next morning, as ſoon as the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe appears, he ſhall begin a journey that ſhall never have end; in which he ſhall ſtill move on, yet never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; for going forward is but as ſtanding ſtill, in that motion to which no period is allotted. But this you know: in a word therefore; Take this book, now your owne: for though your leſſe skill in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue may deny you to have made the Originall, yet the zeal and piety of your Life is the beſt Tranſlation.

               <p>THE ſerious remembrance of Death ſhakes off all ſenſe of Pleaſure, and turnes the ſweeteſt hony to Wormwood. S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The expectation of Death to come, will ſcarcely ſuffer or give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to any carnall delights.</hi> And truly what doth not the ſenſe of Death work, if but entred into the fingers or the pores of the Head, much more when it ſeiſes upon the whole body? it ſpareth no age, no dignity; one young man dies, another Infant, another old man. One dies by the ſword, another by poyſon, a third by a fall; one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts lingringly, another ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as overtaken with ſome violent ſtorme, or thunder clap. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many doubtfull, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſuddain events, what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can be expected? What cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage can there be to ſinne amongſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103505:12"/> ſuch uncertainties? And why? becauſe we die daily. Think of thy houre-glaſſe: though ſlowly to ſenſe, yet certainly by degrees, the ſands doe runne from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt to the nethermoſt Cell. Apply this to thy fleeting life. Every moment ſome parcell of our life ſlides away. Here's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſafe, one houre deceives an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, one moment ſteales ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from another. Happy is hee which makes every day his laſt; more happy hee which reckons every houre; but moſt happy that man who accounts every moment. He will abſtaine from ſinne that counts this preſent moment to be his determined time. Oh deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Hopes! how many have you deluded? While you promiſe to many the end of their journey, old age; and yet cut them off in the middeſt of it in their youth. You make men beleeve that may happen to them which many have enjoyed, the flouriſhing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond tree; what a number have fallen with innocent hands, yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103505:12"/> peccant hearts? How many have been overtaken by Death whileſt they have beene in meditating of wickedneſſe? How many ſinners and ſinnes hath Death cut off in the middeſt of their acts? How many have ſmarted for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſinne, being examples of raſhneſſe &amp; preſumption? Have not many put a period to their lives and ſinnes together? What if thou ſhouldſt be one of this number? Or why ſhouldſt thou be priviledged beyond others? Oh!<note place="margin">Scriban. in Polit. Chriſt. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> who would think to find ſin in that minde, which expects Death with the ſinne, and puniſhment by that Death? No wiſe man will play in a ſtorme at ſea; who in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous precipices will or dare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate tranſgreſſions? No man unarm'd can be merry in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of an Enemies Armie. But much more fooliſh is hee, who knowing every houre, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be uncertaine, and living in a perpetuated feare of Death, yet dares doe thoſe things, which for ever will make Death to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103505:13"/> moſt miſerable. Oh unwiſe men that we are! why doe wee plunge our ſelves into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and why obey we not good counſels!<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.40.</note>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103505:59"/> ſpyed the heads of foure great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Serpents, lying forth out of the ſides of the ditch, yet hee neglecting all theſe dangers, hee lift up his eyes, and beheld ſome Honey dropping from a tree, wherefore he ſuppoſing himſelfe ſecure, forgetting the Unicorne that followed him, the Dragon that threatned him, the Mice that gnawed the roots of the tree, the Serpents that waited him, and the ſudden fall of that tree, hee greedily licked in the Honey, and theſe things (ſaid <hi>Barlaam</hi>) doe ſet forth the folly of our lives: and thus he explained it;</p>
               <p>The Unicorne reſembles Death, which doth purſue all mankind eagerly; The Ditch is this world, which is ſtored with all ſorts of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; The Tree which he caught hold on, is this life terminated within certaine bounds; The two Mice are the night and the day, which eat up the root of the tree by little and little: The foure Serpents are the foure Elements, who if they be out of order, or

               <p>THe Devill being skilful in the perſpective art, uſeth this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning policy, that thoſe things which are furtheſt off, hee makes them ſeem neer unto us, and thoſe which are neer unto us, he makes ſeem a great way diſtant from us. Thus he repreſents Death to us, that though it be ſo neere us, that it is ready to lay hold on us, yet it appeares a great way off, hence in a vaine ſecurity wee promiſe to our ſelves many yeares, and put the evill day far from us to our great diſadvantage. Hence is it that wee looke upon other mens Burials, as though ours were not to be this long time, and though we are decaying daily, yet for all that; we fancy an eternity to our own ſouls.</p>

And what man is not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in this kind? we are all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on towards our long home: we are all in the way, and parted but by ſmall diſtances, thoſe which are dead have not ſo much left us, onely they are gone before us, but perhaps thou mayſt ſay, I am healthy and luſty, and finde not, nor feele any the leaſt ſence of ſickneſſe, nor apprehenſion of Death; well! flatter thy ſelfe if

Therefore a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eſteems his life by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not by the extent of it. For nature hath afforded us an Inne to lodge in, not to dwell in, and the uſury of life is like that of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to be alwayes paid at the ſet
